  <h1>Playfair Display and Fauna One</h1>
  <section id="information">
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      Typography is an element of web development which can either make or break
      one's web page. It could be describe as a tool for communicating a text
      effectively to it's user. For today, I'm using <em>Playfair Display</em> and
      <em>Fauna One</em> provided by Google Fonts. Instead of going with what I feel
      will be great fonts, I followed the TypeConnection method, <i>Embrace The Other</i>.

    <h2>How they embrace eachother?</h2>
    <p>
      Playfair, a late 18th century transitional design, is a serif font which is
      influenced from desings like <em>Scotch Roman</em>. John Baskverville, a
      transitional serif typeface designer, also influenced the desing. Playfair
      Display is great for headings and text which requires readers/users attention.
      On the other hand, Fauna One is a font which is used in paragraphs. With low
      contrast strokes and soft terminals, it embraces the bold design and sharpness
      of playfair display.
